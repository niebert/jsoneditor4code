`docs/index.html` in your browser as privacy-friendly [AppLSAC-2](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/WebApps_with_LocalStorage_and_AppCache/Types_of_AppLSAC).
All files, that are equired  for the AppLSAC to run are stored in the docs folder. Only if you are planing the change the source code of the AppLSAC `___PKG_EXPORTVAR___` you need the other folders.
